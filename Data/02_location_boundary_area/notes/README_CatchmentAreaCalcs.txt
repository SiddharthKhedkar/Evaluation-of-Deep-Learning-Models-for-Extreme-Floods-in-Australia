The area of a polygon depends on the projection used. 

As per AMGZones.jpg, the "Australian Map Grid" defines zones 49-56 for use over the Australian continent. 

Depending on the longitude of the catchment centroid, each catchment was assigned to one of these zones.  Using ArcMap, the area was calculated using that projection.  The 2020 version of the projections was used - to access these (eg.) right clicks on 'Layers' in the Table of Contents, then Properties > Coordinate System > Projected Coordinate Systems > National Grids > Australia > GDA2020 MGA Zone <num>.
