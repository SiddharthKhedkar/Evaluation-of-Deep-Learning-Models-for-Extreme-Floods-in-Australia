# Evaluation-of-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Extreme-Floods-in-Australia


We offer a study that assesses various deep learning techniques for forecasting multi-step ahead time series. Our focus is on hydrological data from diverse catchments across Australia, aiming to enhance predictions for extreme flood events. After evaluating several methods, we introduce a novel approach that integrates both time series and static features using Quantile LSTM. This strategy demonstrates superior performance compared to previous methods.
